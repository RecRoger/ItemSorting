----Welcome!----

Items Sorting is a full FrontEnd app created to manage 
and sort differents Items objects.

It is frontEnd languages only, HTML, CSS and Javascript, and
it works with the browser LocalStorage as temporary Data Base.

----How to Run:----

As a full frontEnd app, it doesn't need to run on a server or 
previous installation; just open the index.html file on your 
browser to use it.

I hope you enjoy it.
